Research Summary:

1. **Material Properties for PLA (Polylactic Acid):**
   - PLA is a thermoplastic made from fermented plant sugars, commonly used in FDM 3D printing.
   - It is biodegradable and environmentally friendly.
   - PLA has a low printing temperature and minimal warping, making it ideal for beginners.
   - It is known for its ease of use and availability in various colors.

2. **Design for Additive Manufacturing (DfAM) Guidelines for FDM:**
   - Minimum wall thickness: Typically around 0.8 mm for PLA.
   - Minimum hole diameter: Generally 2.0 mm to ensure proper printing without support.
   - Overhangs: Angles above 45° may require support structures.
   - Tolerances: ±0.2 mm is a common guideline for FDM.
   - Orientation: Parts should be oriented to minimize support and improve surface finish on critical faces.

Material properties for FDM 3D printing include a variety of options such as PLA, ABS, and PETG. These materials are commonly used for general-purpose 3D printing due to their ease of use, affordability, and wide range of applications. PLA is known for its strength and aesthetics, ABS for its heat resistance, and PETG for its flexibility.

Design for Additive Manufacturing (DfAM) constraints for FDM include considerations for minimum wall thickness, hole diameters, and overhang/bridge rules. It is important to ensure that designs are self-supporting above certain angles, typically around 45 degrees, and to use fillets or chamfers to aid in this. Tolerances for FDM are generally around ±0.2 mm or ±0.2% of the dimension, whichever is larger.

Minimum wall thickness for FDM is typically around 0.8 mm, and minimum hole diameter is around 2.0 mm. These constraints ensure that the printed parts are structurally sound and can be printed without issues.
